This notebook is based on a [FHIR Connectathon Project](https://github.com/plangthorne/python-fhir/blob/master/demo/BulkDataDemo.ipynb) that was also set up to implement simple authentication according to [SMART Authorization Guide protocol](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/authorization/backend-services/), but we're ignoring this aspect since it's a bit technical and out of scope for this class.
